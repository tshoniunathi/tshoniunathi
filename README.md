<!--Level 1: Simple bio and stats-->

<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Unathi Tshoni</h1>

<h2> 🎓 Academic turning technologist </h2>
I come from an academic and scientific research background, where curiosity and discovery were at the core of my work. Research taught me discipline, patience, and a love for discovering the essence of how things work below the surface.

That same curiosity is now what draws me into the tech world. I’m pursuing a path in technology because it affords me the tools to be innovative, test ideas, and develop solutions that make a real, tangible difference. It also allows me space to invent and push boundaries, while solving meaningful problems through hands-on learning and creative experimentation.

<h2> 💻 My adventure in tech</h2>
I’ve explored frontend web development and continue to build my skills in it, though my main focus has shifted toward AWS Cloud Computing. I am currently pursuing the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification with the AWS Re/Start Programe. Along this journey, I’ve discovered (so far),a strong interests in: 
🗄️Databases &rarr; data modelling, querying, and understanding how systems store and manage information
🔐Security &rarr; ensuring systems, networks, and data stay protected
🌐Networking  &rarr; understanding how systems communicate and how cloud infrastructure is designed
📈Data  &rarr; exploring the power of data analysis and how insights can guide decisions

<h2> 🚀 In the lab: Current Affairs</h2>
- AWS Learning Modules  to get cloud practitioner certification
- build a strong foundation in cloud computing

<h2> 🎯 What's next?</h2>
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect
- AWS Certified Database - Specialty
- AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty
